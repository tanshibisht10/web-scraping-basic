# web-scraping-basic
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting information from websites. Here’s a brief overview of its key components:

HTML and DOM Understanding: Knowledge of HTML structure and the Document Object Model (DOM) is crucial for identifying and extracting data.

HTTP Requests: Scraping starts by sending HTTP requests to servers to retrieve HTML content.

Parsing HTML: Tools like Beautiful Soup (Python) are used to parse HTML and navigate the DOM.

Data Extraction: After locating elements in the HTML, the desired data (text, links, images) is extracted.

Data Storage: Extracted data can be saved in formats like CSV, JSON, or databases.

Legal and Ethical Considerations: Ensure adherence to the website’s terms of service and copyright laws.
